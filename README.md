# Drone_Archaeology
Coding used to process drone-captured Near-Infrared Images into Normalised Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) greyscale images which are then further processed using both a segmentation of ndvi around the tomb region followed by a contour overlay in the perimeter of the tombs. Version 2 uses a standard contour, Version 4 is an attempt, with limited success, to overlay feature boxes over the tomb images with the intent to extend the code into more automated feature detection. Updates to this last step will be ongoing.
